## Introduction

**gw-text** provides some text processing functions for color aware strings and templates.

## Examples

This manual is a interactive.  Navigate to sections of the manual using the menu on the left side. 

On each page, click on any example to modify its source and re-run it by clicking elsewhere. 

**Note:** Examples in this manual use the `SHOW()` function, which is not a part of `gw-text`. This helper function is available only to interactive examples and is thankfully copied from **rot.js**.

## Github
